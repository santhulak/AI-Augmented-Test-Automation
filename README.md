# 🤖 AI-Augmented Test Automation  
### From Script Execution to Intelligent Test Maintenance

This project demonstrates how to augment traditional test automation using Playwright with AI-assisted techniques to improve debugging, reduce maintenance effort, and identify test gaps.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Modern test automation frameworks like Playwright are excellent at execution and reporting, but they lack intelligence in:

- Identifying root causes of failures  
- Suggesting fixes  
- Highlighting missing test coverage  

This project introduces a **lightweight AI-augmented layer** that transforms automation into a **decision-support system**.

---

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

### ✅ Failure Intelligence
- Captures structured failure context  
- Analyzes error, locator, and DOM  
- Classifies failure type  
- Suggests actionable fixes  

---

### ✅ Locator Resilience
- Identifies brittle locators  
- Suggests stable alternatives  
- Promotes strategy-based selectors  

---

### ✅ Coverage Insights
- Highlights missing test scenarios  
- Identifies gaps in validation  
- Supports better test design  

---

### ✅ Human-in-the-Loop
- AI suggests, engineers validate  
- No automatic test modification  
- Ensures reliability and control

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
### 2️⃣ Install Playwright browsers
```
npx playwright install
```
### ▶️ How to Run the Demo

🔹 Step 1 — Run test (intentional failure)
```
npm run test
```
👉 This will:

Execute login test
Fail due to incorrect locator
Generate failure context

🔹 Step 2 — View failure context

Open:
```
artifacts/failure-context.json
```
Example:
```
{
  "error": "locator.click: Test timeout...",
  "locator": "#loginBtn",
  "url": "file:///...",
  "dom": "DOM not available"
}
{
  "error": "locator.click: Test timeout...",
  "locator": "#loginBtn",
  "url": "file:///...",
  "dom": "DOM not available"
}
```
🔹 Step 3 — Run AI analysis
```
npm run analyze
```
Example output:
```
{
  "failure_type": "LOCATOR_CHANGED",
  "root_cause": "loginBtn does not exist. Actual ID is submitBtn",
  "suggested_fix": "#submitBtn"
}
```
🔹 Step 4 — Fix the test

Update locator:
```
await page.locator('#submitBtn').click();
```
OR use resilient locator:
```
await page.locator('button:has-text("Login")').click();
```

🔹 Step 5 — Re-run test
```
npm run test
```
👉 Result:
```
1 passed
```
**🎯 Demo Flow Summary**
Test fails due to locator issue
Failure context is captured
AI analyzes the failure
Root cause and fix are identified
Test is updated and passes

**💡 Key Takeaways**
Move from execution → intelligence
Reduce debugging time
Improve test stability
Identify missing coverage
Maintain human control

**⚠️ Notes**
This demo uses a mock AI analyzer for stability
Can be extended with real AI APIs
Fully offline-capable for reliable demos

**🔮 Future Enhancements**
Real AI API integration
Automated test suggestion system
CI/CD integration
Visual dashboard for insights
